I'm please to announce VScaladoc2 web service (beta)

at http://vscaladoc.alchim31.net/

## VScaladoc2 :

* allow registration of apidoc in several formats (Javadoc2, Scaladoc (1 & 2), VScaladoc2 (json))
  for every format except vscaladoc2, request will be redirected
* display api in json generated by VScaladoc2_genjson in html,
  lot of updates of the renderer don't need to regenerate json data.
* support documentation in overview.html, package.html
* support multi-artifacts project and cross artifact reference
* support custom doctag
  by default every doctags are displays, but some could have special display (eg : deprecated, tags (wip))
  so today, you could use doctags you like, generate doc / release and have better display tomorrow
  @tags use a space separeted list of keyword
* provide a primitive discussion system (google-groups as back-end)
  * no messages stored by vscaladoc => no risk to drop messages if vscaladoc fails 
  * no registration need
  * you manage/moderate as you wish
  * native email integration/notification => more reactivity
  * other back-end are possible (nabble,...) [request it]

You could browse the [demo] and use the document icon on right side to display discussion (if number  > 0) or start a new one if (number == 0).
Due to the non-API provide by google-groups, number are refresh periodicaly ~ 30 min.

Full Api of Lift 2.2-M1 is under [framework_2.8.0] (name of the root artifact)

## The web service (QoS) :

* it is in staging, so reporting bugs, suggestions,... are all welcome
* every 24H the server hibernate (rule for [host](http://stax.net)), some features/renderer could take time to restart (lazy) and cache to be updated
* it can be updated/restarted several times by week
* it doesn't host your data (api, comment), it only cache or redirect
